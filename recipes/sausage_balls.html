        These sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat, a holiday party appetizer, or a game-day nibble. Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese team up for a yummy savory flavor that can't be beaten! My family makes these every Christmas morning.
